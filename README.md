# Boston-Housing-Dataset

## Overview
This is a simple Regression problem to predict the Median Value of the houses in Boston. The trained model takes few criteria like CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX etc as input and determines MEDV.

## Technical Aspect

### a) Input
1. CRIM - Crime rate per capita
2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned
3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres
4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable
5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration
6. RM - average number of rooms
7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate
11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio
12. B - proportion of blacks
13. LSTAT - % lower status of the population

### b) Output
1. MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes

### c) Data Analysis
1. Missing values
2. Outlier detection
3. Feature Engineering - Feature Selection (Select KBest, Chi square, ANOVA, Pearson Correlation, p-value)
4. Feature Scaling - Standard Scaler 
5. Hyperparameter tuning

### d) Algorithms used
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Lasso Regression

### e) Accuracy
R2 score

### f) Programming Language 
Python

### g) Framework
Jupyter Notebooks
